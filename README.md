# Railroad Builder using Kruskal's Algorithm
This Java program, developed as a part of a university assignment (COP3503 Fall 2023), implements Kruskal's Algorithm to build a railroad network. The program reads track details from a file, constructs a minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's Algorithm, and computes the minimum cost required to build the railroad.
